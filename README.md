# Anurag's Todo List App

Anurag's Todo List App is a simple web application built with React. It allows users to add tasks with titles and descriptions, view them in a list, and delete tasks as needed. The app is designed to be easy to use and intuitive for managing tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks with titles and descriptions.
- View all tasks in a list format.
- Delete tasks individually.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd anurag-todo-list
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Usage

- To add a task, enter the title and description in the respective input fields and click "Add Task".
- To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task in the list.
